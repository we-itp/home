    `The Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) at NYU Tisch is a graduate program that focuses on the imaginative and experimental use of communications technologies—how they might augment, impact, and bring delight and art into people's lives. Given the interdisciplinary nature of the program, WE @ ITP aims to provide specialized peer-to-peer guidance and support for exploring various career paths that may branch out of ITP.`,
    `We developed a mentorship model to connect graduating students with ITP alumni for long-term one-on-one support, which has now merged with a new program run by the Tisch Student Affairs office. Participating students across Tisch will be matched with mentors according to areas of interest.`,
