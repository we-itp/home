const AboutText = [
    'WE @ ITP began as an effort to both better understand the workforce that we as ITP students would be entering into, and to create an environment at ITP where people can share experiences and advice that could help us as a collective.',
    'Our mission is to destigmatize open conversation around salaries and work experience and gain exposure to a variety of career paths.',
    `The ITP (Interactive Telecommunications Program) at NYU Tisch is a graduate program that focuses on the imaginative and experimental use of communications technologies â€” how they might augment, improve, and bring delight and art into people's lives. Given the interdisciplinary nature of the program, WE @ ITP aims to provide specialized guidance and mentorship for various career paths that may branch out of ITP.`,
    'We are working in a partnership with the Tisch Career offices to help them better understand the uniquely wide range of careers that ITP students will be applying for. We merged efforts on a mentorship program that will better serve and equip ITP graduates alongside their colleagues in other Tisch programs.',
